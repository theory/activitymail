activitymail version 1.02
=========================

This program may be used for sending email messages for CVS repository
activity. There are a number of different modes supported. It can send
messages for every change to the repository (like syncmail), or it can be used
to send a single message for each commit. In the latter case, a list of all
the files affected by the commit will be assembled and listed in the single
message. This is similar to how commit_prep and log_accum work, but is more
efficient.

An additional option allows for diffs to be calculated for the recent changes,
and either appended to the message (like syncmail) or added as an attachment
(neater). See the -d and -a options in the documentation.
