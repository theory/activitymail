Revision history for activitymail.

1.03
       - Added -e option so that the cvs executable can be specified.
       - Added -u option to specify the From header of email messages.
       - Added -g option to use $USER environment variable for grouping
         commit transactions. Useful for connecting via :pserver:, where
         grouping via pgrp won't work. Thanks to Derek Scherger for suggesting
         these last three changes.
       - Added "Bugs" section to documentation with a link to the CPAN Request
         Tracker
