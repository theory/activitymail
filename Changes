Revision history for activitymail.

1.04
       - Turned off output buffering, which will hopefully allow status
         messages to be printed as they happen.
       - Added "X-Mailer" header to mail messages, so that people who see
         activitymail messages in archives and such and want to know how
         they were created will be able to find activitymail.

1.03   2002-08-05 2002 18:34:51
       - Added -e option so that the cvs executable can be specified.
       - Added -u option to specify the From header of email messages.
       - Added -g option to use $USER environment variable for grouping
         commit transactions. Useful for connecting via :pserver:, where
         grouping via pgrp won't work. Thanks to Derek Scherger for suggesting
         these last three changes.
       - Added "Bugs" section to documentation with a link to the CPAN Request
         Tracker
       - Changed example domains in documentation to "example.com".
