Revision history for activitymail.

1.12
       - Documented -V option. Thanks to Hernan Otero for the spot.
       - Fixed file names in diffs against /dev/null so that they're properly
         displayed in the diff headers.
       - Removed a few superfluous commas from the diff shell commands.
       - File names in diff headers are now full paths from the repository
         root. This change should make it possible to actually apply the diff
         from the root by simply doing `patch -p0 < activitymail.patch`.
       - Added -N option to specify the location of the null file. Will be
         useful on those systems that don't have /dev/null (e.g., Win32).

1.11   Fri Aug 29 16:53:25 2003
       - Updated information and links to other CVS notification applications.
       - Simple status messages (new directories, imports) and syncmail mode
         once again send email message bodies.
       - Simple status messages and syncmail mode now send HTML email if
         the -H option has been passed.

1.10   Wed Aug 27 23:25:21 2003
       - Added empty lines between the text of the commit message and the
         attached diff. This looks neater in mail clients that display
         attachments inline.
       - Added -H option sending HTML email. Thanks to Hernan Otero for
         the initial implementation.
       - Added -V option to include revision numbers after each listed file.
         Thanks to Hernan Otero for the initial implementation.
       - Cut down on the number of times that data is copied in the script,
         thus reducing processing time and memory requirements, especially
         on big commits.
       - Added -w option for a link to a CVSWeb view of the diff for each
         changed file. Actually looks best when used with HTML. Thanks to
         Hernan Otero for the initial implementation.
       - Added check for binary files so that they won't be diffed.
       - Added -B option to specify a list of binary file name extensions
         to indicate files that should not be diffed.
       - New files and deleted files are now diffed against /dev/null in
         order to provide a more realistic diff.
       - Added -j option to point to a diff executable to compare added and
         deleted files. Defaults to "diff", assuming that it's in the path.
       - Added -M option to prevent messages over a maximum size from being
         emailed. Thanks to Sam Tregar.
       - Added -S option to add directory context information to the subject.
         Thanks to Kent Lindquist.
       - Branch tags are now listed in the email under their own header.
         Suggested by David Krembs.
       - Added -v option to print the version number.
       - Added POD tests.
       - Switched to Module::Build for installation.

       - Turned off output buffering, which will hopefully allow status
         messages to be printed as they happen.
       - Added "X-Mailer" header to mail messages, so that people who see
         activitymail messages in archives and such and want to know how
         they were created will be able to find activitymail.

1.03   2002-08-05 18:34:51
       - Added -e option so that the cvs executable can be specified.
       - Added -u option to specify the From header of email messages.
       - Added -g option to use $USER environment variable for grouping
         commit transactions. Useful for connecting via :pserver:, where
         grouping via pgrp won't work. Thanks to Derek Scherger for suggesting
         these last three changes.
       - Added "Bugs" section to documentation with a link to the CPAN Request
         Tracker
       - Changed example domains in documentation to "example.com".

1.02   2002-06-30 19:16:03
       - Fixed problem with global filehandles getting closed in the wrong
         places, thanks to Scott Lanning.
       - Created distribution package so that activitymail can be properly
         installed on a system.

1.01   2002-05-22 20:58:41
       - Added -o option so that diff options can be passed through to diff.
